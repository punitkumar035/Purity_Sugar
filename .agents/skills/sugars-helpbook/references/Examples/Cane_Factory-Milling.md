<span class="hcp5">The model of a complete cane raw sugar factory is
given in the Cane Factory (Milling)
example.</span><span class="hcp6"> </span><span class="hcp5"> A
five-mill train with compound imbibition and steam driven mills is shown
in the figure above (page

ratio could be set to the fiber in the cane as an alternative method for
controlling the steam
quantity.</span><span class="hcp6"> </span><span class="hcp5"> Each mill
grouping behaves in the same manner; that is, cane or bagasse flows into
the separator station where it is separated into fiber and
juice.</span><span class="hcp6"> </span><span class="hcp5"> The fiber
with some bound sucrose and non-sucrose components passes through the
separator and leaves in output no. 1, and all of the juice passes
through the separator and leaves in output no. 2 after losing some of
its sucrose and non-sucrose components to the fiber that goes out output
no. 1.</span><span class="hcp6"> </span><span class="hcp5"> The moisture
content of the bagasse leaving each mill is set in the blender
station.</span><span class="hcp6"> </span><span class="hcp5"> Setting
the mill separator and blender data involves getting typical moisture
values for the bagasse leaving each mill and setting the blenders to the
measured moisture
values.</span><span class="hcp6"> </span><span class="hcp5"> Then, the
separator stations in each mill grouping are first set to only separate
fiber from the juice and then doing a balance to see how much adjustment
is needed in each mill separator station to match the final bagasse
sucrose content and mixed juice %DS and Purity.</span>

<span class="hcp5">The clarifier is constructed from four Sugars

distributor.</span><span class="hcp6"> </span><span class="hcp5"> Heat

<span class="hcp5">Mud from the clarifier is sent to the vacuum filter

Pump stations are used in the model to increase the pressure of the
imbibition juice (station nos. 146, 156 and 166), limed juice (station
no. 230), and clarified juice (station no. 355). Increasing the pressure
of these flow streams prevents any water/vapor phase changes that could
possibly occur if the temperature of the flow exceeds the vaporization
temperature at the flow stream pressure. If phase change (flashing) does
occur in these flow streams, the heat exchanger and blender stations
associated with these flow streams will be affected by the phase change
and the heating flow quantities into the heat exchangers will increase
significantly resulting in balance problems for the model.

In the multiple-effect (page 4 shown in the figure above), condensate
flashing is used on 2nd, 3rd and 4th condensates; however, the 4th
condensate is split in distributor station no. 3401 so that some
condensate can be used for centrifugal wash water at its higher
temperature (the rest is flashed and sent to the hot water tank). Hot
water is used for imbibition and for vacuum filter wash water.

The cooling tower is modeled using a flash tank (station no. 4020) and a
cooler (station no. 4021) to give cooling water at the correct
temperature for the pan and evaporator condensers. Excess water from the
cooling loop is discharged from distributor station no. 4040.

The Net Process Revenues window for the complete model is shown above.
Using this window, any changes made to the model can be evaluated
quickly for their impact on the process revenues. For example, what
would be the effect on the revenues if the imbibition water were
changed?

The imbibition water used by the mill train is controlled by blender
station no. 159. The properties window for blender station no. 159
before changing the imbibition water is shown above. As shown, the
imbibition water is controlled by a ratio of 1.8 to the fiber content in
the cane. Increasing this ratio will increase the imbibition water.
Change the blender<span style="font-size: 10pt;">'</span>s ratio to 2.2
to give a 22.22% increase in the imbibition water rate used by the mill;
and then, redo the balance calculations (that is, click on the full
balance icon) to see how the model will change with the new imbibition
water quantity. After the balance is completed, changes that occur in
each flow stream can be reviewed by double clicking on the flow stream
to display its properties, or by printing out the results for evaluation
and review. However, a quick method for finding the impact on the
performance of the factory with additional imbibition water is to
display the Net Process Revenues window and compare the new net process
revenues with the revenues before the change was made.

The above window shows the new net process revenues after increasing the
imbibition water ratio to 2.2 and rebalancing the model. As shown, the
revenues increase to 174,240 currency units per day. This is an increase
of 4,248 currency units per day (US dollars in this example) and over a
300 day campaign the total increase would amount to 1,274,400 currency
units. Review of the data for the two balance calculations shows that
when increasing the imbibition water for the model: (1) sugar content of
the bagasse out decreases, (2) A and B sugar production increases, (3)
exhaust steam consumption increases, (4) molasses leaving the model
increases, (5) milk of lime consumption increases, and (6) cold water
consumption increases. The cake from the vacuum filter shows a slight
reduction in the quantity of cake and a small reduction in its sugar
content. This is a result of the dilution of the juice at the higher
rate of imbibition water used in the mill train and the specified
moisture content for the cake leaving the vacuum filter.

 

Other stations in the model can be evaluated easily for their impact on
the process revenues generated by the factory using procedures similar
to the one shown above for the increase in imbibition water.
